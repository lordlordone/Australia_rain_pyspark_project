**Project Description:**

For this project, my group and I attempted to solve the Kaggle challenge 'Rain in Australia' by simulating a distributed environment. To achieve this, we avoided using pandas on the complete dataset and instead worked with portions of the dataset. For the analysis and model development, we utilized Spark and MLlib.

The challenge involved predicting whether it would rain the next day, and in case of rain, we also attempted to develop a regression model to forecast the amount of rainfall in millimeters. This additional model aimed to help predict potential flooding in the Australian territory. We relied on simple meteorological attributes such as air pressure, wind direction, temperature, and the locations of cities across Australia.

By leveraging these techniques, we aimed to contribute to the prediction and prevention of potential floods in the Australian region. 
Please refer to our report and code for further technical details.
